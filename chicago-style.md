# Chicago Style Pizza

## Why is this separate?

Submissions to this repository should follow the principle of least surprise. If I went to some place thinking it was traditional pizza and it was actually deep dish, I would be surprised (and personally, I'd be unhappy—but that's just like my opinion, man). But sometimes, you want deep dish—and we should provide the service of pointing you in the direction of some awesome deep dish, right?
